れんが (Renga) is an experimental Gameboy Emulator written in C# based on the Chroma Framework. Its focus lies on emulation accuracy, as well as utility and customizability for both players and developers. Additionally, this project is used as a "follow along" project for a full re-write of the Gameboy Emulator Development Guide, or GBEDG for short.
